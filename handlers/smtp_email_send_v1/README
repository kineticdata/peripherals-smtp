=== Detailed Description
This handler builds and sends a simple Smtp email directly to an email server based on the specified
info items and parameters passed to the task instance. When an html body is set, the handler will
replace images that have a fully qualified source prefixed with the string 'cid:' with embedded
images. This includes the image files directly into the email rather than requiring the email client
to load them from the Internet.

*NOTE* - This handler was updated 2014/01/17 to allow multiple email addresses (comma separated) in
the To field.  The version did not change because none of the input parameters changed and will be
completely compatible with exiting nodes that use this handler.
