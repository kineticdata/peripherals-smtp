== ICS_EventInvite_Send
Creats an ICS calendar event and sends the file via email to a list of
recipients

IMPORTANT:  To use this handler you must remove the mail.jar file from the
kineticTask application.  The mail.jar file is stored in the following directory
kineticTask/WEB-INF/lib.  This will require you to restart your web server as
well.  This is necessary because mail.jar is an unused jar file and it creates a
conflict with a library used by this handler.  This step will not be necessary
with versions of Kinetic Task 1.0.3 or later because mail.jar will no longer be
distributed with the application.
